- Emphasize best practices
- Practice using proper Git workflow (feature branching, pull requests, etc.)
- Practice Agile team management
- Work in pairs to accomplish tasks
- Create a set of models/schemas that properly matches the functional and technical criteria of the application
- Create an authentication scheme that supports non-logged-in, logged-in, and administrator users
